## Antario - CSGO Base

As this base is NOT finished yet, feel free to post issues / pull requests with everything you think shoud be included. 


### Features:

 * D3D9 menu with automatically adjusted positions of the selectables
 * Netvar manager
 * Easy to understand VMT hooking class
 * Debug console output
 * Basic Hooking/Unhooking concept
 * Bunnyhop included (wow such feature)
 * Engine prediction with a simple tickbase fix and spread fix (for nospread servers)


Menu is quite simple to replace (if you'd prefer imgui), just remove all calls to it from hooks.
